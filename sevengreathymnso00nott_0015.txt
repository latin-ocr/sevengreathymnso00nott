THE

CELESTIAL COUNTRV.

ERNARD DE MORLAS, monk of Clu-

ni, is not to be confounded with the great
Bernard his contemporary, Abbot of Clairvaux,
and Saint in the Romish calendar. The place
of his nativity is uncertain, and the years of his
birth and of his death are alike unknown. He
lived during the first half of the twelfth cen-
tury3 he was born, according to one authority,
at Marlaix, in Bretagne3 according to another,
at Morlas, in the lower Pyrenees 3 whilst a third
gives his birth-place to Engkmd, and claffes him
with her illustrious writers (De illzstribus Angliae
Scriptoribus).¹ After seven centuries of com-
parative forgetfulness, the genius of two Engliffi
scholars has revived a portion of his works ·‚ and
hereafter his name will be best known in that

country, which may poffibly poffess his birth-
place.
