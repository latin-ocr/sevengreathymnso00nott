2 The Celcstz‘czl Comztry.

There still survive of his writings five poems,
the greatest os which is De Contempta Mundi.
It was written about 1145, and contains three
thousand lines, divided into three books. In
substance the poem is a satire, unforgiving and
severe: in form it is in dac'stylic hexameter verse,
wherein each line confists of three parts, and
two of these parts rhyme with each other, while
the lines themselves are in couplets of double
rhyme. It is a verse pedantically called “leonine
“and tailed rhyme, with lines in three parts,
“⁸ between which a exesura is not admiffible.''2

The poem commences thus:

Hora novissima. Η tempora pesslma Η sunt, vigilemus.
Ecce minaciter Η imminet arbim· Η illc supremus.
Imminet, imminet Η et mala terminet, Η aequa coronet,
Recta remuneres, Η anxia liber-ct, Η aethem donet,
Auferat aspi-ra Η duraque pondera Η mentes onustes,

Sobria muniat, Η improba puniat, Η utraque juste.

Hours of the latest! times of the basest! our vigil before us!
judgment eternal os Being supernal now hanging o'er us!

Evil to terminate, equity vindicate, corneth the Kingly3
Righteousness seeing‚ anxious hearts froeing, crowning ench singly,
Bearing lifc's weariness, tasting life's bitterness, life as it must be3

Th' righteous retaining, sinncrs arraigning, judging all juilly.
