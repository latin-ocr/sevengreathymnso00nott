The Celessz'al Counfry. 3

This verse, so difficult that the English lan-
guage is incapable of expreffing it, is continued
through the three thousand lines of the poem.
In his preface the monk avows the belief that
nothing but the special inspiration of the SPIRIT
of GOD enabled him to employ it through so
long a poem. After recounting its difficulties,
and alluding to the faint attempts of the two
great verfifiers of his day, Hildebert de Lavar-
'din and VVichard of Lyons, he exclaims: “I
“may then assert, not in ostentation, but with
“humble confidence, that if I had not received
“direo'tly from on high the gift of inspiration
“and intelligence, I had not dared to attempt
“an enterprise so little accorded to the powers

“of the human mind.’'

“ This work‚'' says the author of the Histoire Littfiraire de la
Francc, “was drawn from the dust in 1483, and its publication
“ was achieved on the tenth of December of the same year„ at
‘⁶ Paris, in magni domo campi Gaillardi. The Protestants‚ eager
“ to gather every thing which appears unfavorable to the Church
“ of Rome, have fince multiplied the editions. Some Catholics
“ have also given to it some praise33 and surely it merits them2
“at least by the sentiments of piety which it exhales, and by the
“zeal with which the author attacks the abusos of his time.''
