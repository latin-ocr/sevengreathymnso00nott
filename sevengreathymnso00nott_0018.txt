“ In holy Rome the only power is gold3
There all is bought—there every thing is sold.
Because she is the very way to right,
There truth is perished by unholy sseight.
Even as the wheel turns, Rome to evil turns,
Rome, that spreads fragrance as when incense burns.
Rome wrongs mankind, and reaches men the road
To flee far off from Righteousness' abode!
To seek for ruinous and disgraceful gain,
The pallium's self with fimony to stain.
If aught you wish, be sure a goodly bribe
Will haste the sealing of the lingering scribe.
Rise! follow! let your penny go before,
Seek boldly then the threshold3 fear no more
Thac any stumbling-blocks will bar the way,
The Pope's own favor you can get for pay—-
Without that help, 'tis best to keep away.’'

This a great scholar of our time has taken from
the poen] and brought uddnn the reach and
notice of the world (Trenchf). It also has been
re-woven into fimple English verse, and has re-
ceived the appropriate name of THE CELESTIAL

COUNTRY.
