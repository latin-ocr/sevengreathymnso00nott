* 'The Celcste'czl Coemlry. 5

The transsator of THE CELESTIAL CoUNTRY
is Dr. John Mason Neale, Warden of Sack-
ville College, Suffex, England, the most succeff-
ful transsator of mediaeval hymns, and one of
the most varied and voluminous writers of the
time. “Lays and Legends of the Church of
England ;’' “ A Church History for Children ;''
seven volumes of romances; a history of Greece 3
a history of Portuga13 of the Patriarchate of
Alexandria, and of the Jansenist Church of
Holland3 a large number of tales and hymns
for children, and a most learned and elaborate
commentary on the Book of Psalms, are included
in the long catalogue of his works.

This scholar of Cambridge, and this monk of
Cluni, have given to the religious world the
sweetest and dearest religious poem that our lan-
guage contains. Dr. Neale says that he looks
upon the lines of Bernard “as the most lovely,
“ in'the same way that the Dies [ναξ is the most
“ sublime, and the Stabat Mater the most pathetic
“ of mediaeval poems,'’ but his own poem may
claim more justly that word. THE CELESTIAL
CoUNTRY is better than De Contempta Mundi.
