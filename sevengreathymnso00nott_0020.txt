The beautiful fimplicity of its artless, childlike
lines portrays more naturally the fervid imagery
of the monk. After seven hundred years of
darkness, the holy fervor of Bernard re—kindles

by the Most High. In another language, at
another time, and among those who can but
dimly traee his name in the crumbling record
of his works, the Rhyme of the poor monk re·-
lives to gladden the hearts of other Christians,
loved by such as pofl'ess its faith, and treasured
by the gentlest and the best of earth.3
