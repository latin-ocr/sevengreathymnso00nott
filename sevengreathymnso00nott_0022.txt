2.

Arise, arise, good Christian,

Let right to wrong succeed3
Let penitential sorrow

To heavenly gladness lead—-
To the light that hath no evening,

That knows nor moon nor sun,
The light so new and golden,

The light that is but one.

3.
And when the Sole-Begotten

Shall render up once more
The kingdom to the FATHER,

VVhose own it was before,
Then glory yet unheard of

Shall shed abroad its ray,

Resolving all enigmas,

An endless Sabbath-day.

4.

Then, then from his oppress'ors ·
The Hebrew shall go free,
