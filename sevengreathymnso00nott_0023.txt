The Celeste'al Cozmtry.

And celebrate in triumph
The year of Jubilee;

And the sunlit Land that recks not
Of tempest nor of fight,

Shall fold within its bosom
Each happy Israelite—

The Home of fadeless splendor,
Of flowers that fear no thorn,

Where they shall dwell as children,

Who here as exiles mourn.

5.

Midst power that knows no limit,
And wisdom free from bound,
The Beatific Vifion
Shall glad the Saints around—
The peace of all the faithful,
The calm of all the blest,
Inviolate, unvaried,
Divinest, sweetest, best.
Yes, peace! for war is needless—
Yes, calm! for storm is past—-

And goal²from finiffied labor,

And anchorage at last.
