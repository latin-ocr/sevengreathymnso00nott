10 The Celestlcll Comlssff'.

That peace—but who may claim it?
The guileless in their way,
Who keep the ranks of battle,
Who mean the thing they say——
The peace that is for heaven,
And shall be for the earth3
The palace that re-eehoes
&Vith festal song and mirth3
The garden, breathing spices,
The paradise on high3
Grace beautified to glory,

Unceasing minstrelsy.

7.

There nothing can be feeble,
There none can ever mourn,
There nothing is divided,
There nothing can be torn.
’Tis fury, ill, and scandal,
'Tis peaceless peace below3

Peace, endless, strifeless, ageless,

The halls of Syon know.
