The Celcsst'czl Celmlry.

8.

O happy, holy portion,
Refecstion for the blest,
True vifion of true beauty‚
Sweet cure of all distrest!
Strive, man, to Win that glory3
Toil, man, to gain that light3
Send hope before to grasp it,
Till hope be lost in fight3
Till JESUS gives the portion
Those bleffed souls to fill—
,The insatiate, yet satisfied,
The full, yet craving still.

9.

That fulness and that craving

Alike are free from pain,

Where thou, midst heavenly citizens,

A horne like theirs {halt gain.

Here is the warlike trumpet3
There, life set free from fin,

When to the last Great Suppes
The faithful {hall come in3
