12 The Celeste'czl Comzfqr.

When the heavenly net is· laden
With fissles many and great
(So glorious in its fulness,
Yet so inviolate);
And perfe& from unperfe6³ted,
And fall’n from those that stand‚4
And the sheep-flock from the goat-herd
Shall part on either hand.

And these {hall pass to torment,
And those {hall triumph then—
The new peculiar nation,
Blest number of blest men.
Jerusalem demands them;

They paid the price on earth,
And now {hall reap the harvest
In blissfulness and mirth—

The glorious holy people,
Who evermore relied

Upon their Chief and Father,
The King, the Crucified-—

The sacred ransomed number

Now bright with endless ssleen,
