<The Celestial comm-y. 13

Who made the Cross their watchword
Of JESUS Nazarene,
Who (fed with heavenly neffi’fflr

Where foul-like odors play)
Draw out the endless leisure

Of that long vernal day.

II.

And, through the sacred lilies
And flowers on every fide,
The happy deas-bought people
Go wandering far and wide3
Their breasts are filled with gladness,
Their mouths are tun’d to praise,
What time, now safe for ever,
On former fins they gaze:
The foules was the error,
The sadder was the falh

The ampler are the praises
Of Him who pardoned all.
12.

Their one and only anthem,

The fulness of His love,
