14 The Celeste'al Comzl‘ry.

Who gives instead of torment,
Eternal joys above—-

Instead of torment, glory3
Instead of death, that life

Wherewith your happy Country,
True Israelites, is rife.

13.
Brief life is here our portion,
Brief sorrow, short-liv'd care3
The life that knows no ending—-
The tearless life, is there.

14.
O happy retribution!

Short toil, eternal rest3

For mox-tals and for smners
Α manfion with the blest!

That we should look, poor wand'rers,
To have our horne on high!

That worms should seek for dwelling,
Beyond the starry sky!

To all one happy guerdon

Of one celestia] grace3
