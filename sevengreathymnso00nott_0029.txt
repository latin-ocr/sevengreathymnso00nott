The Celcssa'al Colmlry. 15

‚ For all, for all, who mourn their fall,

Is one eterna] place.

And martyrdom hath roses
Upon that heavenly ground3
And white and virgin lilies
For virgin—souls abound.
These grief is turned to pleasure—
Such pleasure as below
No human voice can utter,
No human heart can know3
And after fleshly scandal,
And after this world’s night,
And after storm and whirlwind,
Is calm, and joy, and light.

And now we fight the battle,
But then ffiall wear the crown

Of full and everlasting

And passionless· renown:

And now we WatCh and struggle,
