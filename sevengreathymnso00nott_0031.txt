The Celcsticll Cozsnssy.

The light that hath no evening,
The health that hath no sore,
The life that hath no ending,

But lasteth evermore.

There JESUS shall embraee us,
There JESUS be embraced—-
That spirit’s food and sunssline
Whenee earthly love is chased.
Amidst the happy chorus,
A place, however low,
Shall sslew Him us, and sslewing,

Shall satiate evermO.

20.

By hope We struggle onward:
While here we must be fed

By milk, as tendes infants,
But there by Living Bread.

The night was full of terror,

The morn is bright With gladnes53

The Cross becomes our harbor,

And we triumph after sadness.
