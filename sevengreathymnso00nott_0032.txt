18 The Celzssz‘czl Cozmlry.

21.

And JESUS to His true ones
Brings trophies fair to see3

And JESUS shall be loved, and
Beheld in Galilee—

Beheld‚ when morn shall waken,
And shadows shall decay,

And each true-hearted servant
Shall shine as doth the day3

And every ear shall hear it—
“Behold thy King's array,

Belaold thy Gon in beauty,
The Law hath paſs'd away !''

22.

Yes! Gon my King and Portion,
In fulness of Thy grace,
We then shall see for ever,
And worship face to face.
Then Jacob into Israel,
From earthlier self estranged,

And Leah into Rachel
For‘ever shall be changed35
