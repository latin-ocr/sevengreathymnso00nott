Then all the halls of Syon
For aye shall be complete,

And in the Land of Beauty,
All things of beauty meet.

For thee, O deas, dear Country!
Mine eyes their vigils keep3
For very love, beholding
Thy happy name, they Weep.
The mention of thy glory
Is uncffion to the breast,
And medicine in fiekness,

And love, and life, and rest.

O one, O onely Manfion!
O Paradise of Joy!
Where tears are ever baniffied,
And smiles have no alloy,
Befide thy living waters

All plants are, great and small,

The cedar of the forest,
