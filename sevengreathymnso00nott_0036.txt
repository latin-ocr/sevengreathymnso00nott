28.

The only art thou needest—
Thanksgiving for thy ἰοῖς
The only joy thou seekest—
The Life where Death is not.
And all thine endless leisure,
In sweetest accents, fings
The ill that was thy merit,
The wealth that is thy King's!

JERUSALEM THE GOLDEN,

W1TH MILK AND HONEY BLEST,

BENEATH THY CONTEMPLATION
SINK HEART AND VOICE OPPRESSED.

I KNow NOT, O I KNow NOT,
WHAT SOCIAL JoYs ΑΒΕ THERE!

WHAT RADIANCY OF GLORY,
WHAT LIGHT BEYOND COMPARE!

30.

And when I fain would fing them,
My spirit fails and faint83
