THEY STAND, THOSE HALLS OF SYON,
CONJUBILANT WITH SONG,
AND BRIGHT WITH MANY AN ANGEL,
AND ALL THE MARTYR THRONG;
THE PRINCE IS EVER IN THEM,
THE DAYLIGHT 18 SERENE3
THE PASTURES OF THE BLEssED
ΑΗΕ DECKED IN GLORIOUS SHEEN.

THERE IS THE THRONE OF DAVID,
AND THERE, FROM CARE RELEASED,

THE SONG OF THEM THAT TRIUMPH,
THE SHOUT oF THEM THAT FEAST3

AND THEY WHO, WITH THEIR LEADER,

HAVE CONQJERED IN THE FIGHT,
FOR EVER AND FOR EVER

ΑΒΕ CLAD IN ROBES oF WHITE !7
