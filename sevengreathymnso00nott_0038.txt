O holy, placid harp—notes
Of that eternal hymn!
O sacred, sweet refeaefi‘flon,
And peace of Seraphim!

And divers retributions
That divers rnerits claim3
For midst the constellations
That deck our carthly sky,
This star than that is brighter-a

And so it is on high.

The glory of the ΕΙεᾶῙ

Ο deas and future vifion

That eager hearts expedN
