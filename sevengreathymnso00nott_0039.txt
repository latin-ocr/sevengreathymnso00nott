Eveh now by saith I see thee,
Even here thy walls discern3
To thee my thoughts are kindled,

And strive, and pant, and yearn.

Jerusalem the onely,

That look'st from heaven below,

In thee is all my glory,
In me is all my woe3

And though my body may not,
My spirit seeks thee fain,

Till flesh and earth return me
To earth and flesh again.

O none can tell thy hulwarks,
How glorioussy they rise!
O ¹none can tell thy capitals
Of beautiful device!
Thy loveliness oppreffes
All human thought and heart1.
And none, O peace, O Syon,
Can slng thee as thou art!
