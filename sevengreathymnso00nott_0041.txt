He, Judah’s mystic Lion,
He, Lamb Immaculate.

O fields that know no sorrow!
O state that fears no strife!

O prineely bowers! O land of flowersf
O realm and home of Life!

Jerusalem, exulting
On that securest ssmre,
I hope thee, wish thee, smg thee,
And love thee evermore.¹
I ask not for my merit,
I seek not to deny
My merit is destruCtion,
Α child of wrath am I·,
But yet with Faith Ι venture
And Hope *upon my way3
For those perennial guerdons
I labor night and day.

41.
The best and dearest FATHER,

Who made me and who saved,
