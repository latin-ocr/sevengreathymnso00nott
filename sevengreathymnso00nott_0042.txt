28 <The Celcstzkzl country.

Bore with me in defilement,
And from defilement laved,
When in His strength I struggle,

For very joy I leap,
When in my fin I totter,

I weep, or try to weep:
But grace, sweet grace celestial,
Shall all its love display,

And David's Royal Fountain

Purge every s111 away.

O mine, my golden Syon!
O lovelicr far than gold,

With laurel-—girt battalions,
And safe vi&orious fold!

O sweet and bless'ed Country,
811311 Ι ever see th)v face?

O sweet and blefl'ed Country,
811311 Ι ever win thy grace?

I have the hope within me
To comfort and to bless!

811311 Ι ever win the prize itself?
O tell me, tell me, Yes!
