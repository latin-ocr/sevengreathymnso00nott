The Celeste'czl Comzlry. 37

as not easily to be matched by any mediaeval composition on the
same subjeec. Dean Trench‚ in his ‘Sacred Latin Poetry,' gave
a very beautiful cento of ninety-five lines from the work. From
that cento I transsated the larger part in the first edition of the
present book, following the arrangement of Dean Tzench, and
not that of Bernard. The great popularity which my transsation,
however inferior to the original, attained, is evinced by the very
numerous hymns compiled from it, which have found their way ’
into modern cellefflons3 so that in some shape or other the
Cluniac’s verses have become, as it were, naturalized among us.
This led me to think that a fuller extra& from the Latin, and a

further transsation into English, might not be unacceptable to the
lovers of sacred poetry.’'

“It would be most unthankful did I not express my gratitude
to God for the favor He has given some of the centos made from
the poem, but especially Jcrzgsalcm tlte Golden. It has found a
place in some twenty hymnals, and for the last two years it has
hardly been poffible to read any newspaper, which gives promi-
nence to ecclefiastical news, without seeing its employment
chronicled at some dedication or other festival. It is also a great
favorite with dissenters, and has obtained admiflion to the Roman
Catholic services. ‘And I say this‚’ to quote Bernard's own

preface, ‘in no wise arrogantly, but with all humility, and there-
fore boldly.'

“ But more thankful still am I that the Cluniac's verses should
have soothed the dying hours of many of God's servants, the
most striking instance, of which 1 know, is related in the
memoir published by Mr. Bmwnlow, under the title, A Little
Child shall lead them,- where he says that the child of whom
he writes, when suffering agonies which the medical attendants
declared to be almost unparalleled, would lie without a murmur
or motion, while the whole four hundred lines were read.
