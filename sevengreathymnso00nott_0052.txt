38 The Celcstz'al Cozlllsry'.

“I have no hefitation in saying that I look on these verses of
Bernard as the most lovely, in the same way that the Dies Irae
is the most sublime, and the Stabat Mater the most pathetic cf
mediaeval poems. They are even superior to that glorious hymn
on the same subje&, the De Gloria} ct Gaudiis Paradg'fi of St.
Peter Damiani. For the sake of comparison, I quote some of
the most striking stanzas of the latter, availing myself of the
admirable transsation of Mr. Wackerbarth (Med. ῌγνηης, ‘ad
Edstion, London):

THE GLORY AND JOYS OF PARADISE.

THERE nor waxing moon, nor waning
Suu nor stass in courses brighr3

For the LAMB to that glad city
Shines an everlasting light:

There the daylight bcams for ever,

All unknown are time and night.

1-'0r tl1c Saints, in beauty beaming,
Shine in light and glory pure5

Crowned in triumph's flushing honors,
Joy in unison secure3

And in safety tell their hames,

And their foes' discomfiture.

Freed from every stain of evil,

All their carnal wars are done3
For the fleih made spiritual

And the soul agree in one;
peace unbroken spreads enjoyrnent,

Sin and scandal are unknown.
