<The Celcstz'czl Cozmlry. 41

thence also, by an easy tranfition, to the toil we endure on earth,
and the eternal contemplation of God's glory in Heaven as here.
So again, in a fine but rugged prose in the Nuremberg Mifl'al
for St. Jerome's Day ε

Then, when all carnal strife hath ceased‚
And we from warfare are released,
O grant us in that Heavenly Feast
To see Thee as Thou art:
To Leah give, the battle won,
Her Rachel's dearer beart,
To Martha, when the strife is done,
Her Mary's better part.

“The parallel symbol of Martha and Mary is, however, in
this sense far more common, and is even found in epitaphs, as

in that of Gundreda de XVarren, daughter of William the Con-
queror:

A Martha to the houseless poor, a Niary in her love,
And though her Nhrrha's part be gone, her Mary's lives above.

‘⁶ Bernard‚ in the passage we are confidering, has a double pro-
priety in the changes of which he speaks. Israel, according to
St. Augustine's rendering, means, Hc that beholds God,· Rachel,
according to the unwarrantable mediaeval explanation, That be-
holds the Bcginning, i. c., CHRIST. Thus, the change spoken of
is from earth to the Beatific Vislon3 and has a reference also to
the New Name and White Stone of the Apocalypse.

“The second allegory of Leah and Rachel expounds them of
the Synagogue and the Church3 the third makes them to repre—

sent earthly affliffion patiently endured”-]11cdiaeval Hymns.
