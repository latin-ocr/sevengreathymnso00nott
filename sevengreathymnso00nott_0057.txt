popular3 that of my friend, the Rev, H. L. Jenner, perhaps the
most ecclefiaffical3 and that of another friend, Mr. Edmund
Sedding, which, to my mind, best expresses the meaning of the
words.''—]Wediaeval Hymns. 2d Edition.

10 No copy of De Contempta Mundi is known to be in the
United States‚ and hence the extra& given is only the cento from
Trench's Sacred Latin Poctry, preceded by the first fix lines of
the poem. It is the part first transsated by Dr. Neale, beginning

at the line, “Brief life is here our p01·t'10n.'’

NOTE, that in this edition of The celestia! Coscntry these

changes have been made:

1st. The poem has been divided into irregular stanzas. This
change of form is partly for the convenience of those who love
to refer and re-refer to favorite paffages3 partly to enable chil-
dren readily to sele& frOm it stanzas to be learned or sung3 but
chiefly to render its intermingling sentences more clear to those

who have not become familiar with its construetion.

2d. The punctuation has been materially remodelled and
changed.

3d. The author's text has been altered in three instances‚ where-
in the errors corrected seem manifestly ssips of the pen or blunders
of the compofitor‚ viz„ in the ninth stanza, line fourteen, “ those''
is substituted for “them ;‘' in the twenty-'second stanza, line two,
“ Thy” is substituted for ‘⁴ His‚’‘ and in the forty-first stanza, line
nine, “But‘' is substituted for “ And.'’
