ΤΗΕ DIES IRAE.

FRANCISCAN monk named Thomas,

born near the beginning of the thirteenth
centu1·y,at Celano, a Neapolitan village, achieved
some reputation in his time as the friend and
biographer of St. Francis de Affifi, founder of
the Order of Minorites. About the year 1250, as
is supposed, he wrote a brief lyric, which, reach-
ing above and beyond his creed and time, has
entered in some form into the worship of every
Christian people. In the Romish Burial Ser-
vice it forms the Sequeme for the Dead, and is
sung with solemn majesty at the great Sixtine
Chapel, while portions of it enter into the praise
or meditations of nearly “ all who profess and
call themselves Christians.” So that, becoming
more highly esteemed, and more generally known
with each century of its long history, it is at the

present time both sung at Rome and approved

by all Protestant Christendom.
