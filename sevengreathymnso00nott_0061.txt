transsators have sought to reproduce the form,
and others to preserve the power of the original.
The reader of Scott will remember with what
strength a few stanzas burst on us in the first
reading of “The Lay.” In form and meaning
they hardly claim the name of a transsation, yet
they have caught the spirit of the hymn with a

vividness that nothing in our language equals.

The mass was sung, and prayers were said,
And solemn requiem for the dead 3
And bells toll’d out their mighty peal,
For the 'departed spirit’s weal 3
And ever in the office close
The hymn of intercession rose3
And far the echoing aisses prolong
The awful burden of the song—
D1Es IRAE, DIES ILLA!
SOLVET SAECLUM IN FAVILLA3
