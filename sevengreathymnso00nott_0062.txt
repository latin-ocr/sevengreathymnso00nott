48 The De'es I ηε.

While the pealing organ rung 3
Were it meet with sacred strain

To close my lay so light and vain,
Thus the holy Fathers sung:

That day of wrath, that dreadful day l
When heaven and earth shall pass away,
What power shall be the finner's stay ?
How shall he meet that dreadful day ?

When ffirivelling like a parched scroll
The flaming heavens together roll ·,

When londes yet, and yet more dread,
Swells the high trump that wakes the dead ἵ

Oh ἔ on that day, that wrathful day
When rnan to judgsnent wakes from clay,
Be Thou the trembling smner's stay,
Though heaven and earth ffiall pass away!
