The De'es [ηε. 53

“the most fervent devotion, two lines of his

“ own verslon of DIES IRAE:

‘ My God, my Father, and my Friend,

Do not forsake me in my end.' '‘

In the beautiful fervor of its devotion, Ros—
common's excels all other transsations, but its
verse is not that of the DIES IRAE.

VI.

Crashaw, the contemporary of Herbert, and
friend of Cowley, is the author of this version.
It is the oldest in our language (1646), though
there is a weak paraphrase by Drummond of

Hawthornden, beginning:

Ah, filly soul ! what wilt thou say
When He, whom heaven and earth obey,
Comes man to judge in the last day Ι

No transsation furpaffes Crashaw's in strength,
but the form of his stanza and the measure of
his verse are least like those of the original.
