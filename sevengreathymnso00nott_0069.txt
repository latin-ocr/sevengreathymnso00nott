Ι.

AY of vengeance, without morrow!
Earth shall end in flame and sorrow,

As from Saint and Seer We borrow.

Ah ! What terror is impending,
When the Judge is seen descending,

And each secret veil is sending.

To the throne, the trumpet founding,

Through the sepulchres resounding,

Summons all, with voice astounding.
