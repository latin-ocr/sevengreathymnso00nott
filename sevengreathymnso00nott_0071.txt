The De'es [ηε. 57

4.

Death and Nature, mazed, are quaking,

When, the grave's long ssumber breaking,

Man to judgment is awaking.

5.

On the written Volume's pages,
Life is shown in all its stages—-

Judgment-record of past ages!

6.

Sits the Judge, the raised arraigning,

Darkest mysteries explaining,

Nothing unavenged remaining.

7.
What shall I then say, unfriended7

By no advocate attended,

When the just are scarce defended ?
