8.

King of majesty tremendous,

By Thy saving grace defend us,
Fount of pity, safety send us!

Holy JESUS, meek, forbearing,
For my sms the death-crown wearing,

Save me, in that day, despairing.

Worn and weary, Thou hast fought me ς

By Thy cross and paffion bought me·—
Spare the hope Thy labors brought me.

ΙΙ.

Righteous Judge of retribution,
Give, O give me absolution
Ere the day of diffolution.
