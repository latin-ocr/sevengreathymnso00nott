The Dies [ηε.

12.

As a guilty culprit groaning,
Flussoed my face, my errors owning,

Hear, O God, my spirit's moaning!

13.
Thou to Mary gav'st remiffion,
Heard’st the dying thief's petition,

Bad’st me hope in my contrition.

14.

In my prayers no grace discerning,
Yet on me Thy favor turning,

Save my soul from endless burning.

15.
Give me, when Thy ffieep confiding

Thou art from the goats dividing,

On Thy right a place abiding Ῐ
