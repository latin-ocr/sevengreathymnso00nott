The Dies lrae.

16.

When the wicked are confounded,
And by bitter flames surrounded,

Be my joyful pardon founded !

17.

Prostrate, all my guilt discerning,

Heart as though to ashes turning 3

Save, O save me from the burnings

18.

Day of weeping, When from ashes
Man shall nse mid lightning flashes,
Guilty, trembling with contrition,

Save him, Father, from perdition!
