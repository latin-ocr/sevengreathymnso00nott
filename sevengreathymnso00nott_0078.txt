‘The Dies I ηε.

ΙΙΙ.

DR. COLES.

1.

AY of wrath, that day of burnfflg,
Seer and fibyl speak concerning,
All the world to ashes turning.

2.

Oh, what fear shall it cngender,

When the Judge shall come in splendor.i
Striest to mark and just to renden

Trumpet scattering sounds of wonder,

Rending sepulchres asunder,

Shall resistless summons thunder.
