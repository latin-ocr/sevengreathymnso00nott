The Dz‘es Irae,

4.

Death and Nature stand aghast,
While the dead, in numbers vast,

Rise to answer for the past.

5.

Volume writ by GOD'S own pen,

Chronicling the deeds of rnen,

Shall be brought, and dooms be then.

When the Judge shall fit, behold !
What is secret He’ll unfold,
No just puniffiment withhold.

Ah ! what plea shall I prepare,

To what Patron make my prayer,

When the just well-nigh despair?
