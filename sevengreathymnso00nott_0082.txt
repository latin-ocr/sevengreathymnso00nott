68 ‘The Dies I ηε.

8.

Dreadful KING, all power poffeffing,

Saving freely those confeffing,
Save Thou me, O Fount of Bleffing!

9.

Think, O JESUS, for what reason
Thou didst bear earth's spite and treason,
Nor me lose in that dread season !

10.

Seeking me Thy worn feet hasted,
On the cross Thy soul death tasted ε

Let such travail not be wasted !

11.

Righteous Judge of retribution !

Make me gift of absolution

Ere that day of execution Ῐ
