-The Dies [ηε.

12.

Culprit-like I plead, beart-broken,
On my cheek shame's crimson token:

Let the pardoning word be spoken !

13.
Thou who Mary gav'st remiffion,
Heard’st the dying thief’s petition,

Cheer’st with hope my lost condition.

14.

Though my prayers be void of merit,
What is needful, Thou confer it,
Lest I endless fire inherit!

15.

Be there, Lord, my place decided
With Thy sheep, from goats divided,
Kindly to Thy right hand guided!
