The Dz'es Irae.

12.

Like a criminal I figh,
Blushing, penitently cry:
Pass, LORD, my offences by!

13.

Thou, who Mary erst didst bless,
Heard'st the thief in his distress3

Hope has given me no less.

14.

VVorthless are my prayers and vain,

But in love do th disdain,

Lest I reap eterna} pain!

15.

On Thy right hand grant me place

Mid the sheep, a chosen raceâ€”

Far from goats devoid of grace!
