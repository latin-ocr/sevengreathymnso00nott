72 The De'es I ηε.
16.
When th’ accursed away are driven,

To eternal burnings given,

Call me with the blefl'ed to heaven!

17.
Ι beseech Thee, prostrate lying,

Heart as ashes, contrite, fighing,

Care for me when I am dying!

18.

Day of tears and late repentance,
Man shall rise to hear his sentence:
Him, the child of guilt and error,

Spare, LORD, in that hour of terror!
