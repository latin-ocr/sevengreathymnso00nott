*The Dies [ηε.

16.

When the thunder of Thine ire

Headlong hurls to quenchless fire,

Let Thy welcome me inspire Ῐ

17.

I entreat Thee, bending low,
Heart as affies, full of woe,

Succor in mine end bestow!

18.

When upon that day of tears
Man from dust again appears,
Fate depending on Thy nod:
Spare the finner then, O God!
