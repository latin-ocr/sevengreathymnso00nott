74 The Dies I ηε.

EARL ROSCOMMON.

1.

.HE day of wrath, that dreadful day,

shall the whole world in 311163 lay,

As David and the Sibyls say.

2.

What horror will invade the mind
Vthn the 111·ἰᾶ Judge, who would be kind,

Shall have few venial faults to find.

3.
The last loud trumpet’s Wondrous found

Shall through the rending tombs rebound,

And wake the nations under ground.
