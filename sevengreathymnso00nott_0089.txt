RICHARD CRASHAW

Ι.

EAR’ST thou, my soul, what serious things
Both the Psalm and Sibyl fings
Of a sure Judge, from whose sharp ray
The world in flames shall fly away!

2.

O that Fire l before whose face
Heaven and earth shall find no place:
O those Eyes¹ whose angry light
Must be the day of that dread night.

3.
O that Trump! whose blast shall run

An even round with th’ circling Sun,
