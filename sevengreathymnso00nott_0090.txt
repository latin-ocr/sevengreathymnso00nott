76 <The Dies I ηε.

4.
Nature and death shall with surprise
Behold the pale offender rise,

And view the Judge with conscious eyes.

5.
Then shall, with universal dread,
The sacred, mystic book be read
To try the living and the dead.

6.
The Judge ascende His awful throne 3

He makes each secret fin be known,

And all with shame confess their own.

7.
O then, what interest shall I make

To save my last important stake

When the most just have cause to quake ἔ
