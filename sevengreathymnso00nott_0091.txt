CThe Dies [ηε. 77

4.
Horror of Nature, Hell, and Death 1
When a deep groan from beneath

Shall cry, “ Vse come, we come !'' and all

The caves of night answer one call.

5.
O that book 1 whose leaves so bright
Will set the world in severe light.
O that judge 1 whose hand, whose eye

None can endure, yet none can fly,

6.

Ah then, poor soul! what wilt thou say ?
And to what patron ehoose to pray,

When stass themselves shall stagger, and
The most firm foot no more shall stand?

7.
But Thou giv'st leave, dread Lord, that we
Take shelter from Thyself in Thee3

And with the wings of Thine own dove

Fly to Thy sceptre of soft love !
