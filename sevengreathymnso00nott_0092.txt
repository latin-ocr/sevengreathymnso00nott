78 The Dies [ηε.

8.
Thou mighty, formidable KING!

Thou merov's unexhausted spring,

Some comfortable pity bring!

9.
Forget not what my ransom cost3
Nor let my deas-bought soul be lost.,

In storms of guilty terrors tost.

10.

Thou who for me didst seel such pain,
VVhose precious blood the cross did stain,

Let not these agonies be vain Ι

11.

Thou whom avenging powers obey,
Cancel my debt, too great to pay,

Before the sad accounting day!
