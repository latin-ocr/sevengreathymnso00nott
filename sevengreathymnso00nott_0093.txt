The Dies [ηπ. 79

8.

Dear [LORD], remember in that day
Who was the cause Thou cam'st this way ;

Thy sheep was strayed, and Thou wouldst be
Even lost Thyself in seeking me 1

9.
Shall 311 that labor, all that eost
Of love, and even that loss, be lost?
And this loved soul judged worth no less

Than all that way and weariness?

10.

Just INAercy, then, Thy reck'ning be
&Vith my price, and not with me3
'Twas paid at first with too much pain

To be paid twice, 01⁴ once in vain.

ΙΙ.

Mercy, my Judge, mercy I cry,
With bluffiing cheek and bleeding eye 3
The conscious colors of my fin

Are red without, and pale within.
