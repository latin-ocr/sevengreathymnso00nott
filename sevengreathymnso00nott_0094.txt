ἱ80 -Tloe Dies [ηε.

12.

Surrounded with amazing fears,
Whose load my soul with anguissl bears,

Ι figh, I weep! accept my tears!

13.
Thou 'who wert moved with Mary's grief,
And by absolving of the thies

Hast given me hope, now give relief!

14.
Reje& not my unworthy prayer3
Preserve me from the dangerous snare

Which death and gaping hell prepare.

1 5.
Give my exalted foul a place

Among Thy chosen right-hand race³

The sons of God and heirs of grace.
