<The Dies [νώ. 81

12.

O let Thine own soft bowels pay
Thyself, and so discharge that day l

If Sin ean figh, Love can forgive,

O, say the word, my soul shall live!

13.
Those mereies which Thy Nlary found,

Or who Thy cross confess’d and crowned,
Hope tells my heart the same loves be

Stil] alive, and still for me.

14.

Though both my prayers and tears combine,
Both worthless are, for they are mine3

But Thou Thy bounteous self still be,
And show Thou art by saving me.

15.
O when Thy last frown shall proclaim
The flocks of goats to folds of flame,
And all Thy lost ssleep found shall be,
Let ‘² Come ye bless'ed ’³ then call me l
