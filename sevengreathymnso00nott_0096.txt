82 The Dies Irae.

16.

From that insatiable abyss,
Where flames devour and serpents hiss,

Promote me to thy seat of bliss.

17.
prostrate my contrite heart I send,

My God, my Father, and my Friend :

Do not forsake me in my end !

18.

Well may they curse theIr second breath
Who rise to a reviving death Í¾
Thou great Creator of mankind,

Let guilty man compaffion find!
