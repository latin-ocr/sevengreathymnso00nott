’ἶ after the Dies [νας was written (1268), he lost

his wife, and, broken-hearted, renounced the
world to join, like Thomas of Celano, the
Order of St. Francis. In the ardor of his devo-
tion, he tried to atone by self- -sought to1tures

not only for his own fins, but, like our Saviour,

Μ for the fins of othexs. At last hie sorrows sank t

 

f :zv-

into insanit and ended 1n death.
D) mg about the time that Petrarch was born,
and while Dante was still 3 young man, his
Cantace Spirituali mark the dawning day of
the Italian language. In an old Venetian
copy of these, the historian of the Francis-
cans (VVadding) found 3 number of Latin
poems, amongst which was the STABAT MATER,
and thus established for the Order of St. Francis
the honor of producing, within the same een-
tury, the two most celebrated of Latin hymns.
Few English verfions of the STABAT MATER
have been made, and not one which striE'tly
preserves its measure. That of Lord Lindsay

is selee’oed here as best expreffing the pathos of
the original.
