THE STABAT MATER.

LORD LINDSAY.

Ι.

Y the Cross, sad vigil keeping,
Stood the mournful mother weeping,
While on it tbe Saviour bung3
In that bour of deep distress,
Pierced the sword of bitterness
Through her beart with sorrow wrong.

2.

Oh! how sad, how woe-begone
VVas that ever-blessed one,

Mother of the Son of God!
Oh Ῐ what bitter tears ss1e sbed
Whilst before ber JESUS bled

'Neath the Father’s penal rod.¹
