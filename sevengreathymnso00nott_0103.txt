‘The Stabat [Walter.

3.
Who’s the man could view unmoved
CHRIST'S sweet mother5 whom HE loved,
In such dire extremity?
Who his pitying tears withhold,
CHRIST'S sweet mother to behold
Sharing in His agony ?

4.
For the Father’s broken law,
Mary thus the Saviour saw
Sport of human cruelties—

Saw her sweet, her only Son,

God-forsaken and undone,
Die a finless sacrifice !

5.
Mary mother, fount of love,
Make me share thy sorrow, move
All my foul to sympathy Ῐ
Make my heart within me glow

With the love of JESUS—so
Shall I find acceptancy.
