<she Stabat Mater.

6.

Print, O Mother, on my beari,
Deeply print the wounds, the smart
Of my Saviour's chastisement3

He who, to redeem my loss,

Deigned to blood upon the cross—
Make me share His punishment.

7.
Ever with thee, at thy fide,
'Neath the CHRIST, the Crucified,
Mournful mother, let me be!
By the Cross sad vigil keeping,
Ever watchful, ever weeping,
Thy companion constantlyl

8.
Maid of maidens, undefiled,

Mother gracious, mother mssd,

91

Melt my heart to weep with thee Ῐ

Crown me with CHRIST'S thorny wreath,

Make me confort of His death,
Sharer of His vkstory.
