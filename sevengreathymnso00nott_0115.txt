4.

Come Thou in whom our toil is swee‘t,
Our shadow in the moon-day beat,

Before whom mourning flieth fleet.

5.

Bright Sun of Grace! Thy sunshine dart
On all who cry to Thee apart,
And fill with gladness every heart.

ὁ.

Whate’er without Thy aid is wrought,
Or {kilful deed, or wisest thought,

God counts it vain and merely naught„

7.

O cleanse us that we sm no more,
O'er parched souls Thy waters pour3
Heal the sad beart that aeheth sore.
