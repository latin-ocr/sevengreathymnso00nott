<The Veni Smffle. 101

8.

Thy will be ours in all our ways;
O melt the frozen with Thy rays3

Call home the 10st in error's maze.

9.

And grant us, LORD, who cry to Thee3
And hold the Faith in unity,

Thy precious gifts of charity.

10.

That we may live in holiness‚

And find in death our happiness,
And dwell with Thee in lasting bliss!
