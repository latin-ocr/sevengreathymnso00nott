There remains of his muse an epitaph on
Adrian I., in thirty-eight verses3 the Song of
Roland, an ode to the scholar VVarnefride, and
an epigram in hexameter verse. This epigram
was found in a manuscript containing a com-
mentary on the Epgssle to the Romans, attributed
to Origen, and correffoed in the hand of Char—
lemagne. The subject of the hymn seems also
to have engaged the attention of the Emperor,
for there is a letter by him addreffed to his
bishops, entitled De gratia shptiformis Spiritus.
, He died at Aix-la-Chapelle, his crown upon his
head, and his copy of the Gospels upon his
knees, January 28, 814.

The English version of the hymn is the para—
phrase of Dryden, of which YVarton says ; “This
“is a most elegant and beautiful little morsel,
“and one of his most correct compofitions.”
There is a transsation in the Prayer Book (Or-
dering of Priests) which is noteworthy, as being
the only Breviary hymn retained by the Episco-
pal Church.
