'The [ΓέΗὶ Cl'CclIOl'.

REFINE and purge our earthly parts3
But, oh, inflame and fire our heart5!
Our frailties help, our vice control,
Submit the senses to the sou13

And When rebellious they are grown,

Then lay Thy hand and hold 'em down.

CHASE from our minds th’ infernal foe,
And peace the fruit of love bestow 3

And lest our feet should step astray,
Prote& and guide us on the way.

NIAKE us eterna] truths receive,
And pracffise all that we believe3
Give us Thyself, that we may see
The Father and the Son by Theee

IMMORTAL honor, endless fame,
Attend the Almighty Father’s name:
The Saviour Son be glorified,

Who for lost man’s redemption died3
And equal adoration be,

Eternal paraclete, to Thee.
