<The V exillcz Regis. 109

“ This world—famous hyrnn, one of the grand-
est in the treasury of the Latin Church, was
composed by Fortunatus on occafion of the
reception of certain relies by Saint Gregory of
Tours and Saint Radegunde, previoussy to the
consecration of a church at Poitiers. It is

therefore strietly and primarily a proceffional
hymn, though, very naturally, afterwards adapted
to Paffion-tide.''—Mediaeval Plymns.

“ C'est de Fortunat qu⁷est le VEX1LLA REGIS
compose, a l'occafion du morceau de la vraie
croix, envoye' par l’empereur justin a St. Rade-
gonde.''—Bi0graphie Univevselle.

The last two verses were added when the

hymn was appropriated to Paffion—tide. The
ending of Fortunatus is this:

“ With fragrance dropping from each bough,
Sweeter than sweetest ne&ar thou:
Decked with the fruit of peace and praise,
And glor-ivus with Triumphal lays :—

“ Hail, Altar! Han, Ο νίξὶίῐῃ ! Thee
Dccks now Thy Paffion's ViCtory3
Where Life for finners death endured,
And life by death for man procured.''
