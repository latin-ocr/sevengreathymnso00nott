THE VEXILLA REGIS.

DR. NEALE.

HE Royal Banners forward g03
The Cross {hines forth in mystic glow;
VVhere He in fless1, our flesh who made,

Our sentence bore, our ransom pald.

Where deep for us the spear was dy’d,
Life's torrent ruffiing from His fide,

To wash us in that precious flood
Where mingled water flow’d, and blood.

Fulfill'd is all that David told

In true prophetie song of old 3
Amidst the nations GOD, saith he,
Hath reign'd and triumph'd from the Tree.
