The V eccz‘llcz Rege&

4.
O Tree of Beauty ! Tree of Light Ι
Ο Tree with royal purple dight !
Ele& on whose triumphal breast
Those holy limbs should find their rest Ῐ

5.

On whose dear arms, so widely flung,

The weight of this world's ransom hung 2

The price of human kind to pay,
And spoil the Spoiler of his prey.

6.

O Cross, our one relianee, hail ,¹
This holy Paffion-tide, avail
To give fresh merit to the saint,
And pardon to the penitent.

7.

To Thee, Eternal Three in One,
Let homage meet by all be done 3

Whom by the Cross Thou dost restore,

Preserve and govern evermore.
