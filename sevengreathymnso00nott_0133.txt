DR. NEALE.

HE strain upraise ofjoy and praise, Alleluia.
2. To the glory of their King
Shall the ransom'd people smg Alleluia.

3. And the Choirs that dwell on high
shall re-echo through the sky Alleluia.

4. They through the fields of paradise that roam,
The blessed ones, repeat through that bright
home Alleluia.
5. The planets glitt'ring on their heavenly way,
The shining constellations, join, and say
Alleluia.
6. Ye clouds that onward sweep!
Ye winds on pinions light ἔ
Ye thunders, echoing loud and deep !
Ye lightnings, wildly bright Ῐ

In sweet consent unite your Alleluia.
