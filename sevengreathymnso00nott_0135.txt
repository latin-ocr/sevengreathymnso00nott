‘The A llel eleale& Sequelu‘e. 1 19

7. Ye floods and ocean billows Ῐ
Ye storms and winter snow !
Ye days of cloudless beauty !
Hoar frost and summer glow 1

Ye groves that wave in spring,

And glorious forests, fing Alleluia.

8. First let the birds, with painted plumage gay,
Exalt their great CREATOR'S praise, and say

Alleluia.
9. Then let the beasts of earth, with varying

strain,
Join in Creation’s Hymn, and cry again

Alleluia.

10. Here let the mountains thunder forth, sono-
rous, Alleluia.
Ι 1. There, let the valleys fing in gentler chorus,
Alleluia.
12. Thou jubilant abyss of ocean, cry Alleluia.
13. Ye traE'oe of earth and continents, reply
Alleluia.
14. To GOD, who all Creation made,
15. The frequent hymn be duly paid: Alleluia.
16. This is the strain, the eternal strain, the
LoRD of all things loves: Alleluia.
