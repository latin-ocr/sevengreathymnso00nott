17. This is the song, the heav’nly song, that
CHRIST Himself approves: Alleluia.
18. Wherefore we fing, both heart and voice

awaking, Alleluia,
19. And children's voices echo, answer making,
Alleluia.

· 20, Now from all men be out—pour'd
Alleluia to the LORD 3

With Alleluia evermore

The SON and SPIRIT we adore.

21. Praise be done to the THREE in ONE.
