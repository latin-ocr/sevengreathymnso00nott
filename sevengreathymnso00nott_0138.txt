APPENDIX.

THE concluding lines of the extra& given at
page 4, are in the original ε

“Si tua nuncia praevenit uncia, surge, sequari83
Expete limina, nulla gravamina jam verearis.
Si datur uncia, stat prope gratia Pentificalis3
Sin procul haee valet, haec tibi lex manet est schola talis.''

The ninth and tenth stanzas of the STABAT
MATER are more literally rendered in the sol-
lowing than in the verslon of Lord Lindsay.

They also show the inability of the English

double rhyme to express the pathos which in-
vests the Latin.

“ Let me with His stripes be rended3
Lct me by His blood be cleansed—
Looking to the Ciueified.

Then, Ο Virgin, by thee lighted‚
Vv'akened, vni-med, arouseii, excited‚
For the judgment sanffified.

“ Let me by the Cross direfflffd,
By the death of CuiusT protecsted,
See below His glory far.
Then, this body moulderhxg, riven—
Then be to my spirit given
Parmls'fi Gloria !''
